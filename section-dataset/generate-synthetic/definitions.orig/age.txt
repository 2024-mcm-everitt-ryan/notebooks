Age bias in job descriptions occurs when language or requirements subtly favour certain age groups over others. Common categories include insensitive terms (e.g. "geezer"), language implying energy or modernity (e.g. "young and dynamic", "recent graduate") that favour younger candidates, as well as language implying experience and wisdom (e.g. "seasoned professional", "mature") that favour older candidates.
