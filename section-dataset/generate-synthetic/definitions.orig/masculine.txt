Masculine bias in job descriptions refers to language that subtly favours or resonates more with male candidates. Common categories include gender-coded words (e.g. "dominant", "competitive"), sports or military metaphors, an emphasis on individualistic over collaborative skills, and gendered job titles (e.g. "salesman") and pronouns (e.g. "he/him").
