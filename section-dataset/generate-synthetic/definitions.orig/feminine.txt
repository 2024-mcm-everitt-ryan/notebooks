Feminine bias in job descriptions refers to language that subtly favours or resonates more with female candidates.  Common categories include gender-coded words (e.g. "nurturing," "supportive"), domestic or caregiving metaphors, an emphasis on collaborative over individualistic skills, and gendered job titles (e.g. "hostess") and pronouns (e.g. "she/her").
