Disability bias in job descriptions involves the use of language or requirements that inadvertently exclude or disadvantage individuals based on disabilities. This can include physical, mental, sensory, or cognitive impairments. Common categories include ableist language that imply the requirement of a physical trait (e.g. "type 50 words per minute") instead of focusing on the job function (e.g. "enter data at 50 words per minute"), unnecessary physical requirements (e.g. "must be able to lift 50 pounds" for a desk job), and the absence of language regarding reasonable accommodations to ensure that candidates with disabilities are assessed based on their suitability for the role.
