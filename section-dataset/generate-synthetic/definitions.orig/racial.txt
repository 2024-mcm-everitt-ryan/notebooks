Racial bias in job descriptions occurs when language or requirements subtly favour certain racial groups or exclude others. Common categories include racially insensitive terms (e.g. "master/slave", "redneck"), exclusionary phrases (e.g. "brown-bag session", "white/black list"), and assumptions about linguistic proficiency or background (e.g. "native English speaker").
