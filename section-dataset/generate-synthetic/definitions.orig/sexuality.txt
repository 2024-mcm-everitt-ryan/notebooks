Sexuality bias in job descriptions occurs when language or requirements subtly favour certain sexual orientations, gender identities, or expressions over others, creating non-inclusive language that can exclude LGBTQ+ individuals. Common categories include terms that enforce heteronormativity (e.g. "the men and women", "opposite sex"), outdated or offensive terminology (e.g. "homosexual", "tranny"), lack of recognition of diverse family structures (e.g. "wife and husband" instead of "partner" or "spouse"), assumptions about gender identity (e.g. "born a man", "sex change"), and non-inclusive pronouns (e.g. "he/she" instead of "they" or "you").
