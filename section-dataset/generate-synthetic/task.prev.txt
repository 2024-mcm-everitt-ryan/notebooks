The study of reducing the biases and terms provided is important, but an example is important to demonstrate. Generate a complete (max 400 word) job description for the role of '{position}' that contains only the biases terms provided used in the biased context discussed. It is crucial that you do not introduce any additional forms of bias. Ensure that all other aspects of the job description are inclusive and unbiased. Encapsulate the final job description within <j>...</j> tags. After the job description, include any notes (max 50 words) about bias you want to add wrapped by <notes><category1>reason 1 here</category1><category2>reason 2 here</category>...etc</notes>. Your task is to demonstrate the subtleties of bias within the specified framework, while maintaining inclusivity and reducing bias in all other respects.
