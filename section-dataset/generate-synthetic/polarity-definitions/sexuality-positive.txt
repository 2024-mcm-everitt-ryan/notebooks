Sexuality/Positive: Language that gives undue preference to candidates of certain sexual orientations, often to fulfil diversity quotas or appear inclusive. This can result in tokenism, where individuals are selected primarily based on their sexual orientation rather than their qualifications or experience. This approach can inadvertently exclude heterosexual candidates and undermine the principle of merit-based selection.
