Racial/Positive: Language that gives undue preference to candidates of certain racial or ethnic backgrounds, often to fulfil diversity quotas or appear inclusive. This can result in tokenism, where individuals are selected primarily based on their race or ethnicity rather than their qualifications or experience. This approach can inadvertently exclude candidates from other racial or ethnic backgrounds and undermine the principle of merit-based selection.
