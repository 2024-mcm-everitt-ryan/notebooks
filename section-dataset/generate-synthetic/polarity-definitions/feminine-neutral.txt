Feminine/Neutral: Language that neither disadvantages nor gives undue preference to any gender. This approach focuses on inclusivity by ensuring job requirements are essential and relevant, avoiding gender-specific terms, and using clear, gender-neutral language such as "they" or "candidate." The aim is to attract a diverse pool of candidates and evaluate them based on merit.
