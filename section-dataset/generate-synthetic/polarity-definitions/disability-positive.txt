Disability/Positive: Language that gives undue preference to candidates with disabilities, often to fulfil diversity quotas or appear inclusive. This can result in tokenism, where individuals with disabilities are selected primarily based on their protected characteristics rather than their qualifications or experience. This approach may unintentionally exclude non-disabled candidates and undermine the principle of merit-based selection.
