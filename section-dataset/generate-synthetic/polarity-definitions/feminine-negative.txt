Feminine/Negative: Discourages non-female candidates from applying by using gender-specific language, referencing female-centric experiences, or assuming certain traits or roles are inherently female. This can occur through the exclusive use of pronouns like "she" or "her," or by assuming caregiving or nurturing skills are necessary, thereby discouraging males and non-binary individuals.
