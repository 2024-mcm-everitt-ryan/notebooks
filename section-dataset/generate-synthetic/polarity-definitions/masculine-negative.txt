Masculine/Negative: Discourages non-male candidates from applying by using gender-specific language, referencing male-centric experiences, or assuming certain traits or roles are inherently male. This can occur through the exclusive use of pronouns like "he" or "him," or by assuming physical strength or competitiveness is necessary, thereby discouraging females and non-binary individuals.
