Adopting a gender-neutral title like \"Fabrication Supervisor\" and rewording the job description to emphasise that experience in areas like \"MIG & TIG\" and \"coded welding\" is preferred but not essential could make the role more appealing to a wider pool of applicants. Additionally, the description includes physically demanding tasks with heavy machinery which might be perceived as exclusive; it could be beneficial to clarify the nature of these physical demands to ensure they don't deter potential candidates.
