Our client, Good Shepherd New Zealand, is a member of a worldwide organisation concerned with creating a more emotionally, economically, and physically safe world for women. Its objective in New Zealand is to support better futures for women, girls, and their whanau who are experiencing disadvantage. A significant area of focus is on supporting the development of financial inclusion and microfinance programmes for New Zealand families living on limited incomes. Believing it is the right of all to have access to fair and affordable credit, Good Shepherd NZ works with key stakeholders including community-based organisations, corporate partners (including two commercial banks providing loan capital), and government to achieve that goal. Domestic microfinance is becoming more recognised in New Zealand as a fair and safe alternative in the small credit market, and Good Shepherd NZ is currently in the process of expanding its microfinance programmes to meet the need that recognition creates.
