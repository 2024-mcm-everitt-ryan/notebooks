I was never a sit-down type of person, always wanted to move around and interact with people. I found that working with children is greatly rewarding: not only are you up on your feet, playing and chatting all day, but you get energized and inspired after every lesson with them, and you can influence their lives for the better. This lifestyle has led me to find a group of like-minded individuals and create a strong team of young professionals, driven, positive, and a lot of fun to be around, while working towards the same goal: to provide the best experience to children in learning English.

We, Lux. English, are a language school and on a hunt for a professional of the same mindset. You will be that teacher you always wanted to have in school: positive, cool, smart, and passionate about the subject.

We will help you with the visa process, and our teachers can give you the ins and outs of the first few months living in Russia. Our team is very diverse. We have teachers from all over the globe.
