    "analysis_racial":"The language is inclusive, designed to promote equal opportunities and a diverse workforce, aligning with modern best practices in HR. This approach is not generally viewed as implicitly biased. However, statements that explicitly encourage applications from specific demographic groups, such as male, or black and minority ethnic candidates, can sometimes be perceived as exclusive of others, despite the intention to enhance diversity. To make this more inclusive, consider rephrasing to encourage all underrepresented groups to apply. For example, \"We particularly welcome applications from those who are underrepresented in our organisation, including but not limited to, individuals from diverse racial backgrounds, genders, and abilities.\" This wording broadens the appeal and inclusivity, reflecting a commitment to diversity without limiting the encouragement to specific groups.",
