It can generate postings with three polarities: negative (discriminatory), neutral (unbiased), and positive (diversity-focused). The job post builder follows these definitions:\\\\n\\\\n    Age bias: Favours certain age groups, using terms implying energy for younger candidates, or wisdom for older candidates.\\\\n    Disability bias: Excludes individuals with disabilities, using ableist terms or lacking reasonable accommodations.\\\\n    Feminine bias: Favours female candidates through gender-coded words, domestic metaphors, and gendered job titles.\\\\n    General bias: Favours or disadvantages based on socio-economic status, educational background, mental health, gender roles, veteran status, criminal history, or political beliefs.\\\\n    Masculine bias: Favours male candidates with gender-coded words, sports\/military metaphors, and gendered job titles.\\\\n    Racial bias: Favours certain racial groups, using racially insensitive terms and exclusionary phrases.\\\\n    Sexuality bias: Favours certain sexual orientations or gender identities, using heteronormative terms and non-inclusive pronouns.\\\\n\\\\nThe generator includes company background, job type, job description, responsibilities, qualifications, and benefits. Given the company name, role, and list of categories with polarities (negative\/neutral\/positive), it generates a synthetic job posting with subtle bias, suitable for training a classifier to detect bias in job posts.
