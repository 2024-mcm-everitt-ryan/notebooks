Have people ever told you that you would be great at sales? That you have such an awesome personality? Are you approachable and exciting and people just love to be around you? Then, we have found the job for you! We are looking for our very own charismatic, ambitious, Communication Sales Rep for our Milwaukee, Wisconsin location!

Ro. Coco, Inc is looking for that guy or girl that can outperform the rest of the pack. You know, the one that crushes it. We want someone who gets charged by closing deals, finding new customers, and making things happen. We're looking for that killer salesperson who understands selling, how to penetrate new accounts, get customer's attention, sell value, and win.

What We Want:
This role will be focused on selling our clients’ telecom, entertainment, and mobility packages to consumers one-on-one, in a retail environment. This communication sales representative will be responsible for executing outbound sales efforts, communicating with our leadership team, and being a student of their craft.

- You're super smart and quick on your feet. You like selling.
- You're a student of sales. You enhance the lives of others around you.
- You're a hunter, you're not afraid to break down barriers. You are results-oriented, and get it done.
- You are not afraid or embarrassed to be rejected. You learn from your failures.
- You thrive in an entrepreneurial environment. Enjoy making new friends and networking.
- You’re a catalyst of positive energy. Plays well with others.

We would love someone who plays full out, has goals so big they get goosebumps when they think about them, and wants to be in the top 1% one day. Maybe you are there now, maybe you strongly desire the skills to get there, but we want someone who has the drive, passion, and grit to get it done. Everything else we can train! (plus it’s paid training which is pretty sweet).

Within this grit though, we have no interest in ego. Rococo Inc. is a team where we communicate openly and truly appreciate everyone’s opinions and perspectives.
