New Wine's vision is to equip churches to live and minister in the power of the Holy Spirit. We are a well-established and stable NFP based in Palmerston North, serving churches and the national Christian community through the provision of coaching, training, and networking events, including our famous annual New Wine Festival.

As part of a fresh strategy and a desire to continue to expand our ministry, an opportunity has arisen for an outstanding Events Coordinator to be the visionary multi-tasker that gets our events off the ground! Your role will be busy and varied, responsible for delivering truly excellent events that drive the vision of our ministry. You will be responsible for teams of both paid staff and volunteers, and no two days will be alike.

You will need to be:
- A Christian: we are a distinctly and intentionally Christian organisation.
- Able to communicate effectively with people from a wide range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds.
- Able to function effectively and independently in a fast-paced, busy environment.
- Able to juggle multiple tasks of differing work-types (logistics and people-leadership).
- Able to lead paid and volunteer staff in event rollouts.
- Teachable: able to learn new skills and strategies in event management.
- Able to manage time effectively and efficiently, planning/scheduling to strict deadlines.
- Comfortable in a broad range of ethnic and cultural contexts/backgrounds, with (ideally) a good working knowledge of Te Tiriti o Waitangi (Treaty of Waitangi).

In return, you will receive:
- Competitive remuneration.
- Expense reimbursements.
- The satisfaction of knowing your work really makes a difference.
- The joy of working with a terrific bunch of committed, passionate, dynamic people!

Note: This is a permanent, part-time role that averages out to 20 hours per week across the year. Due to the seasonal nature of our activities, you will be required to work full-time (40 hours per week) for approximately three months of the year (November to February), and part-time (13.5 hours per week) for the remaining nine months (March to October).

If this sounds like a bit of you, we invite you to get in touch in the first instance for a copy of the Position Description. Please email [Email Redacted] or phone [Phone Number Redacted].
