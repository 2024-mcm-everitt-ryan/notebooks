    "analysis_disability":"The phrase \"willingness to talk a lot\" could deter not only applicants who are not extroverted or prefer not to engage in lengthy conversations, but it could also implicitly exclude those with certain disabilities that affect speech or communication styles. A more inclusive phrasing could be: \"The role requires strong communication skills to effectively address customer queries and provide solutions.\" This version emphasises the need for clear communication without specifying the amount of talking involved, thus broadening the potential applicant pool.",

    "analysis_general":"The phrases \"willingness to talk a lot\" and \"always want to resolve the situation\" could deter candidates who may perceive these as requiring extroverted or aggressive traits. Rephrasing to \"A strong drive for problem-solving and a focus on effective resolutions\" is more inclusive and objective. This wording values problem-solving skills while accommodating different styles and approaches. It reduces bias towards specific personality types or behaviours that are not necessarily indicative of job competence.",
