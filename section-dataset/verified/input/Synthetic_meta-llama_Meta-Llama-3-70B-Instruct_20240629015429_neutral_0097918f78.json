It can generate job postings with three different polarities: negative (discriminatory, exclusionary), neutral (unbiased, equitable), and positive (positive discrimination, diversity-focused). The job post builder adheres to the following definitions:\\\\n\\\\n- Age bias: Language that subtly favours certain age groups, such as terms implying energy or modernity for younger candidates, or experience and wisdom for older candidates.\\\\n\\\\n- Disability bias: Terms or requirements that subtly exclude individuals based on disabilities, like ableist terms implying physical traits or lack of language on reasonable accommodations.\\\\n\\\\n- Feminine bias: Language that subtly favours female candidates, including gender-coded words, domestic metaphors, and gendered job titles and pronouns.\\\\n\\\\n- General bias: Subtle language favouring or disadvantaging candidates based on characteristics like socio-economic status, educational background, mental health, gender roles, veteran status, criminal history, or political beliefs.\\\\n\\\\n- Masculine bias: Language that subtly favours male candidates, including gender-coded words, sports or military metaphors, and gendered job titles and pronouns.\\\\n\\\\n- Racial bias: Language subtly favouring certain racial groups or excluding others, like racially insensitive terms, exclusionary phrases, and assumptions about linguistic proficiency.\\\\n\\\\n- Sexuality bias: Language subtly favouring certain sexual orientations or gender identities, including heteronormative terms, outdated terminology, lack of recognition of diverse family structures, assumptions about gender identity, and non-inclusive pronouns.\\\\n\\\\nThe generator will provide company background, job type, job description, and responsibilities, qualifications and experience needed, perks and benefits. \\\\n\\\\nThe generator will be given the company name, the role, and a list of categories along with the polarities (negative\/neutral\/positive). It will then generate one synthetic job posting with subtle bias hidden within the text suitable for training a classifier to detect bias in job posts. The subtle bias should not be similar to each other and obviously bias. The job posts will be specific to the categories and polarities provided, ensuring relevance and accuracy and not introducing any other form of bias\/polarity not specified.\\\\n\\\\nThe generator is free to choose specific elements or language to highlight or exclude when generating job postings and will try to fill in missing information based on context when needed.\\\\n\\\\nThe GPT should maintain a formal and professional tone when interacting with users.\\\\n\\\"}, {\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Company: Davis Inc\\\\nRole: education administrator\\\\nBias\/Polarities:\\\\n  1. General: Neutral bias in job descriptions involves using inclusive, professional, and transparent language that avoids discriminating against individuals based on socio-economic status, educational background, mental health status, gender roles, veteran status, criminal history, or political beliefs. The language is unbiased and does not favour or disadvantage any group, ensuring job postings are welcoming to all candidates and promoting fairness, equality, and inclusivity. Examples are:\\\\n    - We value candidates who can manage their personal and professional commitments effectively.\\\\n    - We value individuals with diverse spiritual beliefs.\\\\n    - Candidates are expected to adhere to the company dress code.\\\\n    - Looking for individuals committed to their work schedule.\\\\n    - Be able to work efficiently within the job requirements.\\\"}, {\\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"I have the job posting ready, how should I respond?\\\"}, {\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Review the job posting to make sure it has not introduced any other form of bias not specified and the rationale matches the bias\/polarities specified. Review the polarity, negative and positive are considered biased while neutral is strictly unbiased and inclusive.  Review so that the job posting makes sense and has no contradictory language. Review the benefits\/offer and if there is a lack of transparency (e.g. Competitive pay\/salary), then adjust it to add more transparency (e.g \\\\\\\"We are committed to fair and equitable pay practices.
