Senior Market Development Manager, Distributor Markets

Do you want to help improve healthcare standards in developing markets? In the Distributor Markets team, we are on a mission to bring better care to patients in developing markets worldwide and to enable more people with chronic conditions to resume a normal life. We are responsible for driving strategy, business development, and daily operations in close collaboration with our regional sales team and distributors in 60 countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The markets are characterized by low education and awareness about our treatment areas, often poor reimbursement, and lack of/unawareness of patient rights. We aim to change this by building strong partnerships with local distributors, to provide better education to healthcare professionals and support to patients through phone, online activities, and home visits.

The Position

As a Senior Market Development Manager, your role will be to lead the development and implementation of commercial programs to support our journey. Since the region is very dynamic, projects and responsibilities change frequently. From the beginning, it will include (but not be limited to):

- Lead development, investment case creation, and oversee implementation of Coloplast Care and Consumer/DtC activities in 10-15 focus distributor markets.
- Identify growth opportunities, build investment cases with distributors, and oversee implementation.
- Lead the process to improve fact-based performance dialogue with distributors (Build engagement, buy-in, data capture, and presentation).
- Lead creation and maintenance of Market Access project pipeline with the global Market Access team, and oversee project management of pipeline project execution.
- Support commercial setup and organizational design for new distributors in the New Markets sales region.
- Support development of strategy and business development planning.
- Own and facilitate the annual business planning (ABP) process for Distributor Markets, including training and stakeholder engagement with customers.

You will be given plenty of freedom to help decide how we do this, and it is important that you can spot both opportunities and potential challenges and take the initiative to react to them. To succeed with this, you have good leadership skills, and you take ownership naturally. We run many projects at a time and the role is diverse, so it is important that you can easily switch focus from the bigger picture to practical details and reverse. We prioritize execution over planning and prefer trial and error over perfection.
