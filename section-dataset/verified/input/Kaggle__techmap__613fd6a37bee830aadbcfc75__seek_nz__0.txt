Athletics Coaches

For the 2021/2022 season

Nga Tawa Diocesan School is a high-performing secondary school with a reputation for excellence. We aim to provide the best quality coaches to ensure our girls are given every opportunity to excel in their chosen sports. We are currently recruiting for Athletics coaches across three disciplines: sprinting, jumping, and throwing. Athletics is a high participatory sport of choice at Nga Tawa. Successful coaches will work with our Director of Sport to help students reach their potential at a local and regional level, as well as help to maintain high levels of participation in the sport.

From October to April, coaches are required to attend weekly afterschool trainings and attend events on allocated weeknights. The time commitment will amount to approximately six hours per week. Payment will be per hour and will be dependent on coaching experience and qualifications. Nga Tawa will provide generous support, resources, and very competitive terms and conditions to encourage coaches to reach their highest professional standards. Coaches will enjoy the use of excellent facilities and become involved in the Nga Tawa culture.

If you would relish the opportunity to further Nga Tawa's sporting success, then please apply by sending a covering letter, a copy of your C.V., and a completed application form to our Director of Sport, [Name Redacted], at [Email Redacted].
