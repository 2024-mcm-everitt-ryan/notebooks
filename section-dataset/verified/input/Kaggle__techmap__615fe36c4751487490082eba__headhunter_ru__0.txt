Who is an Event Manager at Ezone?

English Zone is not just an "English language school". It's an all-English environment. It's an ecosystem of English educational and entertaining events, programs, and happenings. Concerts, games, movie nights and karaoke nights, masterclasses and open seminars, social clubs, and other activities.

Event Manager is a creative, well-organised person who is in charge of this ecosystem. The person who can constantly come up with an idea of an event and implement it in Ezone themselves: leading the whole process from the beginning to the end. Event Manager is working together with our branch managers, moderators, content creators, and hangout zone hosts.

Duties and responsibilities of an Event Manager:
- Generating the ideas of events and entertaining activities in Ezone (both branches).
- Creating and presenting month and week plans of the events in detail: both programs and organisational issues.
- Leading the organisation of events (delegating the responsibilities to other staff members if needed).
- Cooperating with managers, moderators, and hosts.
- Making sure that we provide high-quality events.

We are looking for people who:
- Have excellent English.
- Extremely goal-oriented.
- Have inspiring personalities and stories to share.
- Eager and quick to learn.
- Are able to think outside the box.
- Friendly and Positive.
- Creative.

Conditions:
- Full-time.
- Salary to be discussed in the interview.
- Professional growth.
