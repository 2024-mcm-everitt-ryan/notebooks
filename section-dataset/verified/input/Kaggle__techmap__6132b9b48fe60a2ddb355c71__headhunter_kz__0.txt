What will I do in Tax?

There are two main functions in Tax services: tax advisory and tax compliance.

- Tax advisory frequently involves working in a multi-disciplinary team and meeting Finance Directors and Senior Managers on client visits.
- Tax compliance implies that you will take a more specialized approach to analyzing clients' business and tax profiles, looking for process improvements and collaborating with advisory colleagues.

Both functions have common principles, starting with an in-depth understanding of the client and a detailed knowledge of the technical issues coupled with communicating complex technical information in a clear and understandable manner.

A typical client relationship involves:

- Extensive preparation and research into the business and client issues.
- Checking client tax returns for accuracy and identifying potential savings.
- Helping clients by checking they have all the information required by tax authorities.
- Organizing client files and preparing initial advice.
- Consulting and communicating with clients' senior management and auditors.
- Mastering and understanding the latest tax legislation and working practices.
- Closely monitoring the client-tax authority relationship.
- Data analysis and modeling to help clients understand the implications of different tax solutions.
- Preparing and presenting pitch proposals, client reports, and recommendations.
