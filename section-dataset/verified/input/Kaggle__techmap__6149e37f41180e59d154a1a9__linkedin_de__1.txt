There are also days that you will stay on the project area to work in the vegetable garden, build a tree nursery, investigate collected bugs, make an inventory of the butterflies, or for example, make chocolate from the cacao you collected. 

Lunch is at 12.30, after which the afternoon is spent usually processing data, analyzing the trap cam videos, determining the collected dung-beetles or frog pictures, writing up research, or working in the garden. 

At 5 pm, there will be a lovely dinner served. After dinner, you can chat with the other students in the community house, play cards, read a book, watch a documentary, chill in a hammock, or just go to sleep. By 6 pm, it is dark, and we expect you to be quiet at 9 pm. 

During the weekend, there will be time to chill and relax, for example, in the hammock, play soccer at the local soccer field, plan a trip to the waterfalls, or the beach.
