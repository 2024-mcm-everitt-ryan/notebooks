About Plecto:

We are a Danish SaaS company, based in Aarhus, with offices in London and Warsaw. We are approx. 45 employees, from 12 different nationalities, aged 19 to 43. Some of us have long educations and international experience. Others are newly hatched and have learned to program while working with us. We believe that anything is possible if you have the right approach and attitude. That's why we take good care of each other while we're here. We work hard and have fun. We hold (under normal circumstances) fantastic parties every month, and every year (again, under normal circumstances) the whole company moves south to talk strategy, have fun, and get to know each other better. We are served fresh croissants and juices every morning and enjoy a delicious lunch. We get free snacks and sodas, have our own gaming club, play PS4 in the kitchen, and have our own disco set-up. What's not to like?
