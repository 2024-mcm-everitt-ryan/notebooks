Description:

At Amazon, we pioneer. At Amazon, we're constantly looking for leaders who can invent, think big, have a bias for action, and who want to deliver for customers. Those principles look very familiar to the men and women who served their country in the armed forces, and also their spouses. Due to Amazon's constant and sustained growth, we need strong, dynamic leaders and technical experts who can harness the skills developed within the military to make a significant impact on the business. Then we have the opportunity for you!

We're seeking an experienced Operations Manager to join our Customer Fulfillment team. You'll operate out of one of our dynamic Fulfillment Centers: these sit at the heart of Amazon's world-class, rapidly growing business. They're where we manage our fast-moving inventory. They're also where we developed our smart, industry-leading workflows. As an Operations Manager, you'll deliver inspiring, supportive leadership for the teams you manage. But at the same time, you don't shy away from rolling up your sleeves and getting involved whenever necessary. You'll be directly responsible for managing a team of Area Managers and their direct reports; meanwhile, you will report to the Senior Operations Manager of your Fulfillment Center.

The quality of your leadership is key to success in this role: you'll motivate and inspire your teams to do their best work, while planning schedules and activities that balance their needs with that of the business. Another key aspect of your role will be to lead on numerous process improvement projects, with the aim of streamlining all activities, both for yourself and the team members you manage. The ideas, innovation, and leaps out of the status quo that you come up with could very well be rolled out across the Amazon network: this immense opportunity is yours for the taking.

Job Description:

Your role will be pivotal in the overall management, control, organisation, and direction of either Outbound or Inbound operational areas of your FC. Your responsibilities will include, amongst others:

- Maintaining Health and Safety standards within your remit area, while promoting an inspiring Health and Safety culture on-site.
- Become a subject matter expert on specific, larger-scale processes and activities within FCs, such as 5S audits.
- In your inventory control and systems environment, you'll manage timely data collection, updating operations metrics on an hourly basis.
