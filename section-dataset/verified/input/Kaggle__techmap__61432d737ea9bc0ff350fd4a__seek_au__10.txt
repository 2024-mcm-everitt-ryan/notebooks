About the role:
The Maddocks Business Development, Communications and Marketing (BCM) team works with the firm’s partners and legal teams to connect with our clients, win work, and position the Maddocks brand in the market.

This is an exciting and varied role for someone who is looking for their initial step into professional services marketing and will provide the candidate with ongoing opportunities to learn and develop their marketing skills. This important role is the glue that binds the team. Providing support to our 4 senior BD team members in Sydney and the wider BCM team, you will be involved in all aspects of our go-to-market strategy, from event management and thought leadership distribution and reporting through to digital, design, and proposal requirements.

Your responsibilities will include but are not limited to:
- Co-ordination and project management of a wide range of internal and external events and seminars (including virtual event management).

- General administrative duties including invoicing, budget management, scheduling, and other administrative tasks.

We work flexibly at Maddocks, whether that's hours, place of work, the leave you take or the everyday flexibility that we all need from time to time. We welcome the opportunity to talk to you about working flexibly.

About you:
You will be either a recent graduate or someone with up to 3 years professional experience, preferably with a degree qualification in Marketing, Business, or Communications. As this is an entry-level position, previous marketing experience in a professional services environment is advantageous but is not essential. To be successful in this role, you will have:
- Excellent written and verbal communication skills including the ability to communicate with stakeholders at all levels.
