The Opportunity

Providing low latency, high system capacity, and high per-user data rates – all necessary requirements for a 5G network – requires both the densification of the radio access network (RAN) and the deployment of additional network nodes. As 5G radio networks increasingly use wider bandwidths, the demand for high throughput micro cells with full macro cell capabilities has increased dramatically. Marvell’s OCTEON Fusion DPUs are targeted for:

- Multi-sector macro cell base stations
- Micro cell base stations
- Intelligent radio heads
- O-RAN-defined distributed units (DUs)

This involves:

- Contract negotiations and statement of work definitions to align customer needs and expectations with the ability to deliver
- Planning and forecasting to best align wafer, substrate, and component supply with customer demand
- Leading business planning activities such as pricing and market sizing

The Product Manager will be responsible for complete alignment between the business unit, the sales organization, and our customers. Within the business unit, s/he will be working with all functions, including software and hardware engineering, finance, operations, and marketing, across the entire lifecycle of multiple products. The successful candidate combines broad technical knowledge of wireless and networking technologies, working experience in the semiconductor space, excellent business/financial understanding, and superb communication skills. He or she will have a deep understanding, not only of our SoC product portfolio, but also of the customer business and use cases.
