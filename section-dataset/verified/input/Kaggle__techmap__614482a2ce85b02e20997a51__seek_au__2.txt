About Reece

We are Australia's most successful supplier of plumbing and bathroom products, with over 600 stores across Australia, over 4,500 staff, and thousands of products. Reece is different. We're a successful national company that doesn't like to make a fuss of our success. We're a big business that works hard to retain the great things from when we were a small business.

Our Onsite business unit is focused on driving the success of our customers through end-to-end supply solutions. We cater for the unique volume requirements of Australia's largest Volume Home Builders. The Onsite team in Pemulwuy, like the broader Reece team, are committed, down-to-earth, and driven people striving for greatness every day.

The Opportunity

In the role of Volume Builder BDM/Account Specialist, you would be part of a tight-knit, successful team focused on delivering the highest level of customer service and satisfaction in a fast-paced environment. This role offers the opportunity to take ownership of and drive significant sales growth with some of Australia's largest Volume Home Builders. You would focus on new business opportunities while also working closely with our key customers. The successful applicant will be able to form multi-level strategic relationships and be comfortable dealing with all stakeholders.

Key responsibilities would include:
- Developing new business
- Establishing strong working relationships with current customers and their staff across all levels, supported by a high level of expertise

Your Learning & Development

Reece prioritises career development for internal staff, and demonstrated success in this role would set you up for further opportunities for development and growth within our large national organisation.

Our Ideal Candidate

We are looking for:
- Strong relationship-building skills
- High customer service focus
- Attention to detail
- Accountability
- An exceptional ability to communicate at all levels
- Good negotiating skills
- A collaborative approach
- The ability to think strategically and identify opportunities

Previous BDM/Account Manager experience, particularly within the construction/development industry, would be valued, but we are also open to other relevant work experience. Need to be comfortable chasing new relationships. We value common sense and culture fit as highly as university degrees and grades. A valid driver's licence and relevant PC skills are required. Experience with CRM systems is preferred.
