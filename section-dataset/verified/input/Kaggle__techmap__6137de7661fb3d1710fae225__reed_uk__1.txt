JOB DESCRIPTION: Multi-skilled Maintenance Engineer

We’re a global company with an unparalleled reputation for delivering the best in specialist heat coatings and treatments. To maintain our high-quality status, we’re seeking a Multi-skilled Maintenance Engineer to support our Birmingham operation. Your role will be very varied, including:

- The repair, test, and replacement of all the site's electrical and mechanical equipment, such as valves, pumps, high-pressure vacuum chambers, and heat treatment plant.
- Some electrical fault finding, test, and replacement – We’ll train you on everything you need to know.
- Control of the spares stock, including items such as thermocouples and production consumables.

This is a days-only role, so you’ll typically be working Monday-Friday, 8:30-4:00. There is the occasional emergency evening call-out that you’ll need to attend, but you’ll share these with a colleague and you’ll get time off in lieu too. It will be your responsibility to take ownership of our PPM programme, ensuring that breakdowns are minimized and that our operation runs smoothly.

PERSON SPECIFICATION: Multi-skilled Maintenance Engineer

You will need to have a proven track record as either a Maintenance Engineer, a Field Service Engineer, or a Multi-skilled Engineer, and any electrical knowledge will be a bonus, but you MUST have heavy industrial capital equipment experience. Although our work environment is very clean and modern, the work needs you to be physically fit and capable of working with heavy pieces of kit.
