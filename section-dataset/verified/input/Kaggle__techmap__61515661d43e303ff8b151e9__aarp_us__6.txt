PeopleReady Skilled Trades is currently hiring experienced Concrete Setters and Finishers for our commercial, multi-family residential, and industrial projects. Providing our clients with quality craftsmanship has given us the reputation as one of South Florida's leading construction solutions team.

As a Concrete Setter and Finisher, you are often responsible for setting the concrete forms and ensuring they have the correct depth and pitch. You'll place the concrete directly from the concrete wagon chute, concrete pump, concrete skip, or wheelbarrow and spread the concrete using shovels and rakes, sometimes using a straightedge back and forth across the top of the forms to "screed," or level, the freshly placed concrete. After leveling the concrete, concrete finishers smooth the surface using either a hand trowel, a long-handled "bull float," or powered floats. After the concrete has been leveled and floated, concrete finishers press an edger between the forms and the concrete to chamfer the edges so that they are less likely to chip.

As a Concrete Setter, you will often be working as part of an exceptional team to lay wooden framework and craft a finished product that is up to the clients' standards. Sign on bonus upon completion of 160 hours.
