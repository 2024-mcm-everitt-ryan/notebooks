Our partner is an exciting operator who is bringing world-class facilities to the Saudi Arabian market. Led by a highly experienced and accomplished senior management team, we are seeking an Area Manager who will support the performance and growth of their female-only clubs. 

With at least five years of sector management experience (preferably multisite), the successful candidate will enjoy P&L responsibility. Therefore, a compelling knowledge of driving revenues, maximising operational performance, and delivering brand standards (from the front line) are prerequisites. Because of their impressive new club pipeline, we are especially keen to speak with candidates that have opened new clubs whilst managing daily fitness operations. 

This position additionally offers an excellent opportunity to advance further into senior management as the business continues to expand. The ability to speak Arabic is not essential; however, candidates must be fluent in English (written and spoken) and have a good understanding of the cultural differences that might be experienced. Saudi Arabia is unquestionably one of the fastest-growing markets within the global fitness industry and provides significant career opportunity and reward to the successful candidate. 

Shortlisted candidates will be invited to submit a video introduction before an online interview with a member of the gofitjobs team.

All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, colour, religion, sex (unless a single-sex facility), sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran, or disability status. Due to operational requirements, the successful candidate will likely be female.
