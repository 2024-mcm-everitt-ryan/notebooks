Person Specification:
To join our Customer team, you'll have excellent verbal and written communication skills as you reach out to a variety of different audiences. Confident working in a fast-paced environment, you'll manage your own workload and flex where required to meet changing deadlines or circumstances. With substantial experience in a customer-facing role, you'll be passionate about delivering the best service possible and be open to adopting new ways of working. Driven and professional at all times, you'll be able to show empathy and understanding whilst retaining the business objectives in mind.

In addition, you'll be required to facilitate customer and/or stakeholder meetings out of normal hours.
