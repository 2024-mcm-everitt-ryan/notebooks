Marys House Services Limited is a not-for-profit providing domestic violence services to women and their children through Mary's House refuge and the Daisy Centre, an outreach support service. We provide women with professional case management addressing housing options, health, education and training, legal issues (including family law, protection orders, and immigration), financial issues, referral to appropriate counselling services, and other services.

We are seeking an experienced senior domestic violence caseworker to provide day-to-day support, mentoring, and leadership to the Casework team, as well as case management support to women and children accessing Marys House Services, including refuge, post-refuge outreach support, and outreach support via The Daisy Centre. Case management is strengths-based, person-centred, and trauma-informed. A feminist approach and perspective applied to understanding domestic violence and the ability to assess from a biopsychosocial model/framework are essential. Caseworkers are required to be part of an after-hours on-call roster, which is paid in addition to normal hours. This position requires initiative and the ability to manage and complete a range of tasks with minimal day-to-day supervision. Casework supervision will be provided by a senior social worker (SSW) and clinical practice supervision is provided monthly by an external clinical supervisor.
