Description

Juniper is an independent established training provider who have been assisting young people to move forward and achieve for 35 years. Delivering Traineeships, Study Programmes, and Apprenticeships, we help young people across the country to take positive steps forward in their lives.

Here at Juniper, we are now looking for an Apprenticeship Engagement Officer to cover Brierley Hill. As our Apprenticeship Engagement Officer, you will:

- Recruit National, Local, Levy, and Non-Levy employers to work with our apprenticeship provision.
- Build relationships with LEP contracts, trade organisations, and other employer organisations to maximise opportunities for partnership working.
- Attend job and recruitment fairs as and when required.
- Support the collection of data from employers (surveys, focus groups, etc.).
- Ensure social media and marketing is current and set up, maintaining a LinkedIn profile to support your role and the profile of Juniper.

This role would suit an individual who is highly motivated and has experience of working to targets. You’ll have excellent verbal communication and negotiation skills and be able to sell the benefits of apprenticeships, including to those reluctant to engage. We’d like someone who has good interpersonal skills and who can work well as part of a team. You’ll be extremely organised, able to provide accurate and timely information to the company, and be innovative and solution-focused. Experience of engaging employers/organisations to provide apprenticeship opportunities is desirable, as is knowledge of apprenticeship standards.

The welfare of our students is paramount; therefore, the successful candidate will be subject to a DBS check.

Benefits:

- Generous paid holidays – 25 days to start with, increasing by length of service up to 30 days.
- A flexible holiday scheme – allows you to buy up to 10 days holiday, or sell up to 5 days holiday (based on full-time).
- An extra day off to celebrate your Birthday.
- J-Fit – a scheme where employees participate in 3 x 45 minute exercise activities each week for a year, your reward…. an additional working week's annual leave!
- A contributory pension scheme.
- Childcare vouchers.
- Cycle to work scheme.
- Excellent working hours – our core business hours are 8:30 am – 4:30 pm, but we appreciate the importance of a good work-life balance and try to accommodate atypical working patterns wherever possible.
- An annual conference and team building day.
