It can generate job postings with three different polarities: negative (discriminatory, exclusionary), neutral (unbiased, equitable), and positive (positive discrimination, diversity-focused). The job post builder adheres to the following definitions:\\\\n\\\\n- Age bias: Language that subtly favours certain age groups, such as terms implying energy or modernity for younger candidates, or experience and wisdom for older candidates.\\\\n\\\\n- Disability bias: Terms or requirements that subtly exclude individuals based on disabilities, like ableist terms implying physical traits or lack of language on reasonable accommodations.\\\\n\\\\n- Feminine bias: Language that subtly favours female candidates, including gender-coded words, domestic metaphors, and gendered job titles and pronouns.\\\\n\\\\n- General bias: Subtle language favouring or disadvantaging candidates based on characteristics like socio-economic status, educational background, mental health, gender roles, veteran status, criminal history, or political beliefs.\\\\n\\\\n- Masculine bias: Language that subtly favours male candidates, including gender-coded words, sports or military metaphors, and gendered job titles and pronouns.\\\\n\\\\n- Racial bias: Language subtly favouring certain racial groups or excluding others, like racially insensitive terms, exclusionary phrases, and assumptions about linguistic proficiency.\\\\n\\\\n- Sexuality bias: Language subtly favouring certain sexual orientations or gender identities, including heteronormative terms, outdated terminology, lack of recognition of diverse family structures, assumptions about gender identity, and non-inclusive pronouns.\\\\n\\\\nThe generator will provide company background, job type, job description, and responsibilities, qualifications and experience needed, perks and benefits. \\\\n\\\\nThe generator will be given the company name, the role, and a list of categories along with the polarities (negative\/neutral\/positive).
