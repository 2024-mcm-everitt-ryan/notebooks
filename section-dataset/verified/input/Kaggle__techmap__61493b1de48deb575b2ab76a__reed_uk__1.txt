We have a fantastic opportunity for people living in Luton and the surrounding areas. Come and be a meter reader, using your great customer service skills and good local knowledge. As a meter reader, you will be on your feet all day, getting the benefits of fresh air and activity along with engaging with the general public in their homes and businesses whilst reading their gas and electricity meters.

We are working in partnership with Morrison Data Services (M Group Services) and on behalf of most of the utility suppliers, so as a meter reader, you will be an ambassador for the world of utilities. The role is relatively flexible, requiring you to work between 40-45 hours per week, between the hours of 8am-8pm Monday to Friday and 8am-6pm on Saturday.

You will need a good level of computer literacy as you will be using a hand-held device on which your daily work schedule will be activated, and an eye for detail is paramount. You need to be able to climb many flights of stairs, bend down into cupboards, and deliver a well-balanced service to all of your customers. A good sense of planning is imperative, knowing your local area well to ensure that you make your day the most productive and fulfilling.

You will receive full training, so experience in the role is not necessary, although it could be a benefit. You will need:
- Full driving license, valid for use within the UK with no more than 6 points
- Access to your own car which will need business insurance
- 5 years' checkable history, including a clear criminal record to pass the screening and vetting standards
- Physical fitness as you can expect to walk up to approximately 8 miles per day
